> **_There was once a frog who made his home in a shallow well. One day he met a turtle from the East Sea._**
>  
<br />
>**_"I'm extremely happy!" the frog told the turtle. "When on the ground, I would leap up and down the railing of the well. When I'm tired, I would rest on the broken bricks."_**
>  
<br />
>**_"Back in the water, I would swim with only my head above the surface. When I walk in the mud, I would bury my feet. I look back at the worms, crabs, and tadpoles who share my well. They can't be as happy as I am."_**
>  
<br />
>**_"The pool of water belongs to me because the well is mine. This is the greatest pleasure!" the frog said proudly. "You should come visit me some time!"_**
>  
<br />
>**_The turtle went with the frog to the shallow well. Lifting his right foot, he tried to enter the well. But it got stuck even before he could extend his left one, so he leisurely retreated._**
>  
<br />
>**_Rather amused, the turtle said, "I can't tell you how vast the East Sea is, for it is beyond measure. However, flood doesn't increase its depth the least bit, and drought can't make it lose an inch. Its depth does not change with time, nor does it change with the amount of rainfall. This is its greatest pleasure!"_**

<br />
>**_On hearing the turtle, the frog was dumbfounded._**
